**Problems:**

A video game has three modes: beginner, intermediate and advanced. For each mode chosen by a player,
the game GUI shows two control objects: a character selection panel and a weapon selection panel. Note
that (a) under different modes the system displays different character selection panels and weapon
selection panels, and (b) it is possible that new modes and/or new control objects may be added in the
future.


1. Apply a design pattern to design the system such that the model can be easily extended to cover future
changes without affecting the code on the client side. You should use a UML class diagram to
document your design.

2. Write Java code to implement your design. You should have a simple test class to show how it works.


**Solution:**

● First, remember to zip the src folder of your project and submit the zip file to the
ungraded assignment named “Lab3CodeSubmission”. One submission from each team.

● Paste a screenshot of a run of your program here.

● Also paste all you source code here.

● Save this report in PDF, then each student needs to submit the pdf report to the graded
assignment named “Lab3ReportSubmission”.
