</p>

b.	Translate your complete design into Java implementation. For this assignment, your code may not be executable. Remember, the goal is to make sure the implementation is consistent with the design. 



**Solution:**

  •	First, remember to zip the src folder of your project and submit the zip file to the ungraded assignment named “Lab1CodeSubmission”. One submission from each team.

  •	Paste all you source code here. 

  •	Paste your updated UML class diagram below.

  •	Save this report in PDF, then each student needs to submit the pdf report to the graded assignment named “Lab1ReportSubmission”.
