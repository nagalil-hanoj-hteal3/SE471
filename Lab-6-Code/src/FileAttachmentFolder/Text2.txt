Student Learning Outcomes
Students that successfully complete the course will be able to:
1. Identify, analyze, and apply skills and professional standards in software verification and
validation.
a. Know verification and validation terminology and foundations for software (e.g.,
planning the verification and validation effort, documenting verification and
validation strategy, including tests and other artifacts, metrics and
measurement, verification and validation involvement at different points in the
life cycle, etc.)
b. Know reviews and static analysis for software (e.g., peer reviews, static analysis,
etc.)
c. Know testing for software (e.g., coverage analysis and structure-based testing,
black-box functional testing techniques, integration testing, quality analysis,
developing test cases based on use cases and/or user stories, testing based on
operational profiles, system and acceptance testing, testing across quality
attributes, regression testing, testing tools and automation, user interface
testing, usability testing, performance testing, etc.)
d. Know problem analysis and reporting for software (e.g., analyzing failure reports,
debugging and fault isolation techniques, defect analysis, problem tracking, etc.)
2. Identify, analyze, and apply skills and professional standards in software quality.
a. Know software quality concepts and culture (e.g., definitions of quality, societyâ€™s
concern for quality, costs and impacts of bad quality, cost of quality model,
quality attributes for software, roles of people, processes, methods, tools, and
technology, etc.)
b. Know process assurance (e.g., the nature of process assurance, quality planning,
process assurance techniques, etc.)
c. Know product assurance (e.g., the nature of product assurance, distinctions
between assurance and verification and validation, quality product models, root
cause analysis and defect prevention, quality product models, root cause
analysis and defect prevention, quality product metrics and measurement,
assessment of product quality attributes, etc.)
3. Identify, analyze, and apply skills and professional standards in security issues.
a. Know developing secure software (e.g., security-related verification and
validation, etc.).
